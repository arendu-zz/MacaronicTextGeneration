                              last December , many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2,000 .

                         now , emboldened by continuing appreciation , some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that .

                                          now that gold has crossed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can ’ t it increase ten-fold , too ?

                   admittedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems .

                      after adjusting for inflation , today ’ s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980 .
