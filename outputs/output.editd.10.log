                              last December , many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2,000 .

                         now , emboldened by continuing appreciation , some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that .

                                       now that gold has crossed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can ’ t it increase ten-fold , too ?

                    admittedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems .
